    "The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively.  Each subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail and head, respectively) and its length (the third number).  NOTE: some of the edge lengths are negative.  NOTE: These graphs may or may not have negative-cost cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to compute the \"shortest shortest path\".  Precisely, you must first identify which, if any, of the three graphs have no negative cycles.  For each such graph, you should compute all-pairs shortest paths and remember the smallest one (i.e., compute \\min_{u,v \\in V} d(u,v),  where d(u,v) denotes the shortest-path distance from u to v). \n",
    "\n",
    "If each of the three graphs has a negative-cost cycle, then enter \"NULL\" in the box below.  If exactly one graph has no negative-cost cycles, then enter the length of its shortest shortest path in the box below.  If two or more of the graphs have no negative-cost cycles, then enter the smallest of the lengths of their shortest shortest paths in the box below.\n",

    "OPTIONAL: You can use whatever algorithm you like to solve this question.  If you have extra time, try comparing the performance of different all-pairs shortest-path algorithms!\n",

    "The first line indicates the number of cities.  Each city is a point in the plane, and each subsequent line indicates the x- and y-coordinates of a single city.  \n",

    "OPTIONAL: If you want bigger data sets to play with, check out the TSP instances from around the world here.  The smallest data set (Western Sahara) has 29 cities, and most of the data sets are much bigger than that.  What's the largest of these data sets that you're able to solve --- using dynamic programming or, if you like, a completely different method?\n",

    "HINT: You might experiment with ways to reduce the data set size.  For example, trying plotting the points.  Can you infer any structure of the optimal solution?  Can you use that structure to speed up your algorithm?"

Each subsequent line specifies a clause via its two literals, with a number denoting the variable and a \"-\" sign denoting logical \"not\".

In the box below, enter a 6-bit string, where the ith bit should be 1 if the ith instance is satisfiable, and 0 otherwise.

For example, 2SAT reduces to computing the strongly connected components of a suitable graph (with two vertices per variable and two directed edges per clause, you should think through the details).  This might be an especially attractive option for those of you who coded up an SCC algorithm in Part 2 of this specialization.  Alternatively, you can use Papadimitriou's randomized local search algorithm.  (The algorithm from lecture is probably too slow as stated, so you might want to make one or more simple modifications to it --- even if this means breaking the analysis given in lecture --- to ensure that it runs in a reasonable amount of time.)  A third approach is via backtracking.  In lecture we mentioned this approach only in passing; see Chapter 9 of the Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani book, for example, for more details."
